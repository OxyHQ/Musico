# @musico/shared-types

Shared TypeScript types for the Musico music streaming platform. This package contains all the interfaces, enums, and types that are shared between the frontend and backend applications to ensure type consistency.

## Overview

Musico is a modern music streaming platform inspired by Spotify, where users can discover, stream, and organize music. This package provides comprehensive type definitions for all core music streaming functionality including songs, playlists, artists, albums, and user libraries.

## Architecture

The platform uses **Oxy** for user authentication and user data management. All user-related data is linked to Oxy users via `oxyUserId` fields.
